![Deconstruder Types](IMAGES/Three%20Flavors.png)

Deconstruder is a toolhead for the voron v0 utilizing the v0.1 carraige and NF crazy. No other hot ends will be supported due to some of the unique features of the NF crazy / mosquito hot end, such as the ability to use four bolts on two different planes to secure the hot end to the toolhead, and the ability to carry a 'fan net' or 'mosquito net' at the bottom of the heatsink frame, as well as the built in 2510 mounting saves a fair amount of weight and space over other options. 
Deconstruder is the same width in X, and shorter in Z than both mini afterburner and mini stealthburner. It also brings the nozzle higher up with the non-volcano heater block option, this is to aid in center of mass as well as reducing the build volume penalty from switching to a volcano heat block. When used with a standard heat block, the nozzle will be approximately 3mm higher than stock. You may have to adjust the position of your Z rails and endstop for this. 

At this point in time, Deconstruder is very experimental. Print and install at your own risk. If you do so, please provide feedback. It would be greatly appreciated and will help the project improve!
